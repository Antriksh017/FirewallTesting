# üîê Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows

## üéØ Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic using **Windows Defender Firewall**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Windows 10/11 built-in **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**
- No additional tools required

---

## üìå Task Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
1. Open the firewall configuration tool
2. View current rules
3. Add a rule to block inbound traffic on **port 23 (Telnet)**
4. (Optional) Test the rule
5. Remove the rule to restore original state
6. Document the process and understand how firewall filtering works

## üîß Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Firewall Configuration
- Open Start Menu ‚Üí Search for  
  **"Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security"**  
- Open the application

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ View Current Rules
- Navigate to **Inbound Rules**
- Scroll through the list to view active rules

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Inbound Rule to Block Port 23
- Go to **Inbound Rules > New Rule**
- Select **Port** ‚Üí Click **Next**
- Choose **TCP**, type **23** ‚Üí Click **Next**
- Select **Block the connection** ‚Üí Next
- Apply to all profiles ‚Üí Next
- Name the rule `Block_Telnet` ‚Üí Finish

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Rule (Telnet not installed)
> **Telnet client was not installed on this system**, so connection testing was skipped.  
> Rule creation was verified via the firewall configuration interface.

*To test manually, Telnet can be enabled via:  
`Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows features on or off > Telnet Client`*

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Remove the Rule
- In **Inbound Rules**, locate `Block_Telnet`
- Right-click ‚Üí **Delete**

## üì∑ Screenshots
- Screenshot of the created `Block_Telnet` rule in **Inbound Rules**
- (Optional) Screenshots of rule creation wizard steps

## üìÑ Summary: How Firewall Filters Traffic

A **firewall** filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on user-defined rules.  
Each rule can:
- Allow or block **specific ports** (e.g., 23 for Telnet, 80 for HTTP)
- Control **TCP/UDP protocols**
- Apply to **Domain, Private, or Public** profiles

By blocking unused or vulnerable ports (like Telnet), you protect your system from unauthorized access or attacks.
